## Data structures:
- Primitive
  - int
  - float
  - char
  - bool `(bool.h)`
  - ...
- Not primitive
  - Linear data
    - Static
      - Array
    - Dynamic
      - Linked list
      - Stack
      - Que
  - Non linear data
    - Tree
    - Graph


## Properties of algorithm
- Input
  Number of input must me greater than or equal to zero
- Output
  Must produce at least q output
- Definiteness
  The step must me clear and unambiguous
- Finiteness
  The algorithm must termiante after finite number of steps
  not matter the input.
- Effectiveness
  The code must be basic enough in principle to be carried out using pencil and paper

The main difference between program and algorithm is that a program doesn't need to satisfy the `finiteness` property.
